## Description
A simple utility for generating [xkcd style passwords](http://xkcd.com/936/).
The project creates a password of varying length based on a user input of how many words
the password should be. There are options to add a symbol, number, or capitalize a letter
in order to fit the requirements for passwords many sites with accounts have. The words of
the password and the numbers and symbols are taken from banks coded into the application.

The logic.php file creates the password based on user input into the form on the index.php file.
